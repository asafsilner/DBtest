# Unity Modular Game Project

This project is a Unity-based game designed with a modular architecture. The goal is to create a flexible and extensible system where different game features and functionalities are developed as independent modules.

## Core Systems:

*   **Event System:** A ScriptableObject-based event system for decoupled communication between modules.
*   **Service Locator:** A simple service locator for managing and accessing shared services.

## Modules (Planned):

*   Grid Management
*   Win Logic
*   Animation System
*   AI
*   Data Export
*   Version Control Integration
*   Plugin System (for user-created content/extensions)
*   UI Management
*   Simulation Controls
